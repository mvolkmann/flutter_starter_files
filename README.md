# flutter_starter_files

This a set of files that can be copied into a new Flutter project
to provide a starting point that I like.

It replaces `lib/main.dart`.
It also adds the `extensions` directory which contains `.dart` files
that add methods to existing classes when imported.

Remove the dependency on `cupertino_icons` in `pubspec.yaml`
if those icons are not being used.
